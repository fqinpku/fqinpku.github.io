# Add Articles to Library
- DOI is the unique identity of any paper
## Zotero + shortdoi + Sci-Hub 
- [-ref-]((https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fFSdjhc09YzgztLzFCl8YQ)​)
### shortdoi
- to auto-fetch DOI names for journal articles, install the add-on zotero-shortdoi
### Sci-Hub
- to Find Available PDF efficiently: Set `Config Editor` as Sci-Hub
- `Preferences - Advanced - Config Editor - search "extensions.zotero.findPDFs.resolvers"`, double click, delete "[]", copy the following codes and click "ok".
```
{
    "name":"Sci-Hub",
    "method":"GET",
    "url":"https://sci-hub.se/{doi}",
    "mode":"html",
    "selector":"#pdf",
    "attribute":"src",
    "automatic":true
}
```
- Sci-Hub's url can be replaced by  https://sci-hub.se, https://sci-hub.tw

## Deal with CNKI's Articles
- You may find problems when "Retrieve  MetaData for PDF" directly
### If you have PDF, Add-on jasminum
- If you have PDF, install the latest version of  jasminum, then `CNKI - Get CNKI Metadata`
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722192254.png)

### If you want to capture from CNKI website directly
#### update Zotero's Website Translator
- download Zotero translators [here](https://github.com/l0o0/translators_CN): `Code - Download ZIP`
- the original translator : `Preferences - Advanced - Files and Folders - Show Data Directory - translators - CNKI.js`
- copy the CNKI.js in the downloaded "translator" folder and replace the initial one

#### install [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) for your Browser

#### to capture a single paper
- just save the website of the paper to your library. Besides, if you have licenses, the full text would be also downloaded automatically. [-ref-](https://blog.csdn.net/m0_55746113/article/details/122825490)​

#### to capture papers  in bulk
- click the symbol of Zotero Connector, choose papers - ok - choose the saving directory. [-ref-](https://blog.csdn.net/m0_55746113/article/details/122825490)

# Self-design Cite Style for Inline Citation and Bibliography
- The idea is to Modify the most similar existed style tailor to your taste, [Eg.](https://www.lianxh.cn/news/4f340fdfb6589.html)​, and there is no shortcut but to try and compare more.
## Where to find the existed style?
- [Chinese-STD-GB-T-7714-related-csl](https://github.com/redleafnew/Chinese-STD-GB-T-7714-related-csl)​
- [Juris M Style](https://juris-m.github.io/styles/)​: can download "Chinese Std GB/T 7714-2005 (numeric, Chinese)"
## Choose the most similar existed style
- from the [website's search](https://editor.citationstyles.org/about/)​, eg "7714"
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722195205.png)
- from the CSL file downloaded from the sources aforementioned, open the file .csl by Visual Studio [-download-](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/), copy the content to clipboard. 
## How to Modify?
### modify manually
#### modify with preview
- [Code Editor Website](https://editor.citationstyles.org/codeEditor/)​
    - click "Edit" button when getting the most similar existed style from Search
    - copy the content of clipboard on the Code editor's window
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722195437.png)
- `Zotero - Preferences - Cite - Style Editor`
    - Choose papers in Zotero, choose style, then you can see the code for the style and preview the chosen papers' bibliography.
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722195520.png)
#### modify without preview, better to compare with different versions: Visual Studio 
#### Eg1. Modify the order method, ie. order according to author or citation number (字母序或引用序)
- ctrl + F: search "ascending"
- `<key macro="author" sort="ascending"/>`
- `<key macro="citation-number" sort="ascending"/>`

### [Visual Editor Website](https://editor.citationstyles.org/)​
#### choose your own example citations
- `Zotero - choose papers - Export Item with Format = CSL JSON` - open the exported file with Visual Studio and copy the content to clipboard
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722195916.png)

- then on the Visual editor website, click on "Example citations - Citation # - Advanced - copy the content on it - Add new reference"
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722200101.png)

#### modify with the following process
- select the part on "EXAMPLE CITATIONS" or "EXAMPLE BIBLIOGRAPHY" you want to modify and tailor the parameters

- Eg1. Add or Delete elements
    - delete volume
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722200203.png)
    - add volume: position where to add volume: `Type = variable; variable = volume; prefix = ", "`
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722200255.png)

- Eg2. Modify Parameters: author name's delimiter, "and" format etc.
    - delimiter
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722200357.png)
    - and: you can choose nothing, "text" - "and" for English paper and "和" for Chinese paper, or "symbol" - "&" for papers.
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722200431.png)
- finally, manually modify the title and id of the style CSL.

#### download the modified version from Visual Editor Website and install on Zotero
- `Visual editor - Style - save style - Download Style; Zotero - Preferences - Cite - Style "+"`
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqinpku/picgo_image/main/20220722200540.png)

# Concludes
## Imperfect
- However, it seem that there's no way to mix different style for Chinese and English paper's Bibliography. So I modify the English version and Chinese Version for papers in different language respectively.

## Shared Modified Version
- Here are some styles modified by myself. You can download from my [Github-Zotero](https://github.com/fqinpku/Zotero) if you like.
- GB7714 中英文混排
